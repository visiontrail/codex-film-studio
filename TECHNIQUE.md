# Build a film

## Working copy

Run `python3 scripts/new_film.py <name> --style whiteboard` from the repository
root. The default destination is `../codex-film-studio-projects/<name>`; use
`--output /absolute/external/path` to choose another location. Destinations
inside the library, including through a symlink, are rejected. All following
commands run inside that external project unless stated otherwise.
Install dependencies with `npm ci`, create a Python virtual environment and
install `requirements.txt`. FFmpeg must be on PATH.

The whiteboard starter's main files are:

| File | What to change |
| --- | --- |
| `content/narration.json` | Narration, stable line IDs, scene regions and claims |
| `content/sources.json` | Factual claims and primary sources |
| `content/shot-plan.json` | Shot intentions |
| `src/film.mjs` | Short-film drawings, camera and timing |
| `src/illustrations.mjs` | Reusable people and objects |
| `src/board.mjs` | Shared stroke and board renderer |
| `src/long-film.mjs`, `editions/long/content/` | Separate long-film example |

The supplied compositions are authored examples, not automatic text-to-scene
templates. Codex must adapt scene IDs, geometry, timing and narration together.
The default lettering supports English; a new script needs appropriate font
paths and subtitle typography before non-Latin text can render correctly.

## Voice

The released demo inputs let you rebuild the examples without a TTS service.
For a new story, choose one of these paths:

1. Connect a **Chatterbox service implementing the API below**:

   ```sh
   export CHATTERBOX_TTS_URL="http://localhost:8000"
   export CHATTERBOX_TTS_API_KEY="your-service-key"
   export CHATTERBOX_VOICE="your-voice-id"
   .venv/bin/python scripts/speech.py
   ```

   The client expects `GET /v1/capabilities` with `max_chars`, a `fingerprint`
   and `voices` (each with `id` and `fingerprint`); `POST /v1/jobs` returns an
   `id`; `GET /v1/jobs/{id}` returns `status` (`completed` or `failed` at the
   end); `GET /v1/jobs/{id}/audio` returns WAV. Requests use `X-API-Key` and
   `Idempotency-Key`. This is a specific service contract, not a claim that
   every Chatterbox installation exposes the same HTTP API. See `speech.py`
   for the generation fields. Run your own service or adapt this client.

2. Generate Chatterbox WAVs separately, or supply your own recordings. Put one
   mono 16-bit PCM WAV per narration ID into a folder (`01.wav`, `02.wav`, ...):

   ```sh
   .venv/bin/python scripts/import_audio.py /path/to/narration-wavs
   ```

Then obtain independent timing and review:

```sh
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-asr.txt
.venv/bin/python scripts/transcribe.py
```

ASR uses MLX Whisper on Apple Silicon. On Linux/other macOS machines install
`faster-whisper` and use `--backend faster-whisper`. Models download on first
use. The released sample already includes its reviewed alignment data.
Do not present a transcript comparison as subjective listening.

Changed narration invalidates the old audio. Keep source/WAV hashes and
original recordings. Speech is used at natural speed. An unresolved transcript
difference blocks final validation; inspect it and repair the actual cause.

## Render

```sh
node scripts/render.mjs --stills
node scripts/render.mjs --draft --start 0 --end 8 --width 960 --out media/preview.mp4
node scripts/validate.mjs
.venv/bin/python scripts/build.py
python3 scripts/serve.py
```

Draft mode permits missing narration and estimated timing. The final build
requires current audio and reconciled alignment. It creates the picture,
mixes voice/music/foley, exports captions and checks the MP4. Full frame atlases
are generated unless `--skip-atlases` is selected. A reference comparison is
generated only when `reference/whiteboard.mp4` is present; this optional file
is LemoLab's [CC BY 4.0 reference](https://github.com/lemomo-ai/lemo-opuscar/releases/download/films/whiteboard.mp4).

All edition-aware commands accept `--edition long`. Outputs stay in the
selected edition's `media/` and `review/` folders. Rebuilding the same sample
uses the same drawing inputs and original audio, but byte-for-byte MP4 identity
is not promised across different platforms and encoder versions.

## Check and share

Review the final stills, consecutive motion and playback. Listen to the audio
when listening tools are available; otherwise state the actual validation
scope. Keep the source and a usable MP4 together. Do not upload private keys,
service settings or provider job records to a public repository.
