# Satellite Briefing · 卫星影像／地理简报

**Package status: starter-ready / 创作起步包.** Geographic camera, real imagery, measurements, local maps and verified footage.

This package provides reusable rules, blank inputs and generic tools. Author the
new subject's characters, scenes, narration, renderer and sound in its own project.
The catalog records local showcase pages separately from a published demo.

## Start with a prompt / 用提示词开始

Open the cloned studio in your coding Agent and paste:

> Use the satellite-briefing style to make a [duration] film about [subject] for [audience],
> with narration and captions in [language]. Read the studio guides, create an
> independent project and prepare the environment yourself. Produce and review
> the film, then deliver a 1080p MP4, editable project and actual review scope.

在 Agent 中打开已克隆的工作室，直接发送：

> 请用 satellite-briefing 风格，为[观众]制作关于[主题]的[时长]视频，使用[语言]配音和字幕。
> 请你自动创建独立项目、准备环境，完成制作与检查，交付 1080p MP4 和可编辑工程。

For an exact sample, give the Agent its title or link and ask it to check for the
original source project and assets first. See [reproduction](../../methods/reproduction.md).

## Reuse and review

New projects select their own facts, cast, identities, voices and assets. Specific
real people use portraits supplied for that production. Keep originals, provider
responses, films and review records in the external project. Contribute reusable
rules and tools back to this style package. The existing showcase pages are retained
examples; their review conclusions do not apply to new films.

Use [frame-review tools](../../scripts/frame_review/README.md), record actual
still inspection, motion playback and listening separately, and repair observed
defects. A successful helper test or render does not establish visual acceptance.
