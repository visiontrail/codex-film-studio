# Caption News · 字幕新闻

**Package status: starter-ready / 创作起步包.** A subject-empty authoring package
for large editorial captions, selective emphasis, ledger graphics and kinetic
entrances. The scene renderer and audio pipeline must be authored per production.

Open the cloned studio in your coding Agent and paste:

> Use the caption-news style to make a [duration] film about [subject] for [audience],
> with narration and captions in [language]. Read the studio guides, create an
> independent project and prepare the environment yourself. Produce and review
> the film, then deliver a 1080p MP4, editable project and actual review scope.

在 Agent 中打开已克隆的工作室，直接发送：

> 请用 caption-news 风格，为[观众]制作关于[主题]的[时长]视频，使用[语言]配音和字幕。
> 请你自动创建独立项目、准备环境，完成制作与检查，交付 1080p MP4 和可编辑工程。

For an exact sample, give the Agent its title or link and ask it to check for the
original source project and assets first. See [reproduction](../../methods/reproduction.md).


The independent project contains [the style guide](STYLE.md),
[empty inputs](starter/INPUTS.md), [caption motion helpers](starter/lib/caption.mjs),
the shared methods and frame-review tools. Creation does not install packages,
contact a provider or reuse another film's story. Use supplied recordings or a
configured voice service, then measure and align the audio in that project.

Read [the starter guide](starter/README.md). Choose a licensed font and a renderer
suited to the new composition; the helpers need only a current Node.js runtime.
The starter contains no finished scene renderer. A separately published film
preview is available on the style page.

## Explore the style

Open the library's `styles/caption-news/showcase/index.html` for an original type study,
visual rules, bilingual navigation and a screening room. Watch the
[complete online film preview](https://visiontrail.github.io/codex-film-studio/styles/caption-news/showcase/index.html#screening).
For local production playback, from the library
root, run `python3 scripts/serve_styles.py --port 8249`, then open
<http://127.0.0.1:8249/styles/caption-news/showcase/index.html>.

The public build downloads a checksum-pinned Release bundle containing the
complete web preview, poster, captions, chapters and credits. Local playback can
still use the retained production registered in `styles.json`. The original
schematic artwork is labelled separately from the video. Production-specific
media and metadata stay in the Release bundle and Pages artifact; they are not
copied into new-film starters or reusable methods.

Reference influence: the editorial visual grammar of
[lemo-opuscar](https://github.com/lemomo-ai/lemo-opuscar)'s Caption News style.
The rules and helpers here are independently authored; no upstream media or
production implementation is bundled.
