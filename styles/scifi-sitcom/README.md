# Sci-Fi Sitcom Toon · 科幻情景喜剧卡通

**Package status: starter-ready / 创作起步包.** Flat cartoon drawing, contrasting performances, camera continuity and spatial comedy.

This package provides reusable rules, blank inputs and generic tools. Author the
new subject's characters, scenes, narration, renderer and sound in its own project.
The catalog records local showcase pages separately from a published demo.

## Explore the style

[Open the Sci-Fi Sitcom Toon page](https://visiontrail.github.io/codex-film-studio/styles/scifi-sitcom/showcase/index.html)
for the finished English sample, a bilingual visual guide, an interactive expression
study and copyable creation prompts. The original reference and frame controls
remain on the [comparison page](https://visiontrail.github.io/codex-film-studio/styles/scifi-sitcom/showcase/comparison.html).
The study illustrates generic expression and timing; its figures are not a required
cast for new productions.

Contours are now stable across frames. The ink helper keeps fixed hand-drawn
roughness without line boil, and the motion guide excludes default camera shake,
idle squash/stretch and repeated body/head jitter. Mouths, blinks and purposeful
actions remain animated. Existing productions must adopt these changes explicitly
and re-render; updating the library alone does not change an exported film.

## Start with a prompt / 用提示词开始

Open the cloned studio in your coding Agent and paste:

> Use the scifi-sitcom style to make a [duration] film about [subject] for [audience],
> with narration and captions in [language]. Read the studio guides, create an
> independent project and prepare the environment yourself. Produce and review
> the film, then deliver a 1080p MP4, editable project and actual review scope.

在 Agent 中打开已克隆的工作室，直接发送：

> 请用 scifi-sitcom 风格，为[观众]制作关于[主题]的[时长]视频，使用[语言]配音和字幕。
> 请你自动创建独立项目、准备环境，完成制作与检查，交付 1080p MP4 和可编辑工程。

For an exact sample, give the Agent its title or link and ask it to check for the
original source project and assets first. See [reproduction](../../methods/reproduction.md).

## Reuse and review

New projects select their own facts, cast, identities, voices and assets. Specific
real people use portraits supplied for that production. Keep originals, provider
responses, films and review records in the external project. Contribute reusable
rules and tools back to this style package. The existing showcase pages are retained
examples; their review conclusions do not apply to new films.

Use [frame-review tools](../../scripts/frame_review/README.md), record actual
still inspection, motion playback and listening separately, and repair observed
defects. A successful helper test or render does not establish visual acceptance.
